# OG Pokedex
OG Pokedex is a web application inspired by the classic Pokemon anime, designed to transport you back to the days of catching 'em all. It features a clean and intuitive interface reminiscent of the show's style, allowing you to browse through a comprehensive database of Pokemon.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON

First I began the project with HTML and CSS. Learning the API was the tricky part for this project, I couldn't get some parts of the API to work like the name. Overall an interesting experience and it was exciting to get most of what I wanted the app to do to work. 


## Lessons Learned:

Although it works as intended, there are some features that I would have liked to add or want to add in the future. Some features include, fixing the name button, adding the cry, and add different generation sprites button. Also I want this to be an app on a mobile device. I feel like I learned a lot from this project in API integration.
